AI in healthcare uses machine-learning and other advanced algorithms to analyze medical data—such as X-rays, CT and MRI scans, lab results, and electronic health records—to support clinical decisions like diagnosis, risk prediction, and reatment planning. Instead of replacing doctors, these systems act as “second readers” that can process huge volumes of data, spot subtle patterns, and provide evidence-based suggestions ([PMC][1]).

Healthcare urgently needs AI because the system faces aging populations, rising chronic disease, staff shortages and exploding amounts of imaging and digital data. Human clinicians are busy and can miss early signs of disease; studies show that AI tools can improve diagnostic accuracy, reduce costs and save time compared with traditional methods, while also reducing some human errors ([ScienceDirect][2]).

In diagnostic imaging, companies are already deploying powerful AI models. Google’s Med-Gemini and related models are trained on chest X-rays,CT scans and other medical images to help generate detailed reports and highlight suspicious findings that radiologists might overlook ([Google Research][3]). 
Siemens Healthineers offers AI-based tools that assist with reading scans and claims hundreds of machine-learning
patents in medical imaging ([Siemens Healthineers][4]). Beyond imaging, autonomous diagnostic AI such as IDx-DR has been authorized by the U.S. FDA to detect diabetic retinopathy directly from retinal photographs, showing how AI can bring specialist-level screening into primary care clinics ([Nature][5]).
